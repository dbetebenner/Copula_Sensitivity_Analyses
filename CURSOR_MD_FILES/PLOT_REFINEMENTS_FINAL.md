# Final Plot Refinements: Delta AIC Distribution

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  
**Impact:** Enhanced readability and interpretability

## Summary

Applied four critical refinements to the `phase1_delta_aic_distributions.pdf` plot based on user feedback:

1. **Extended x-axis range** - Accommodate comonotonic copula without overflow
2. **Reduced top axis font size** - Prevent label crowding
3. **Increased top margin** - Prevent title from crowding
4. **Corrected reference line colors** - Match statistical significance thresholds

## Changes Implemented

### **1. Extended X-Axis Range** (Lines 298-316)

**Problem:** Comonotonic copula results (Œî AIC ‚âà 2-4 million) extended far beyond the x-axis labels, creating visual overflow.

**Solution:** Extended xlim and axis labels to 10 million:

```r
# Extended xlim from 1e6 to 1e7
boxplot(...,
        xlim = c(1, 1e7),  # Extend to 10 million
        ...)

# Added additional axis label at 10 million
axis(1, 
     at = c(..., 1000000, 10000000),
     labels = c(..., "999,999", "9,999,999"),
     ...)
```

**Result:** Comonotonic copula results now display within the plot bounds, improving visual balance.

### **2. Reduced Top Axis Font Size** (Lines 323-331)

**Problem:** Top axis labels (AIC weights) were crowding, causing R to skip labels due to overlap.

**Solution:** Reduced `cex.axis` from 0.85 to 0.65:

```r
axis(3,
     at = delta_for_weights + 1,
     labels = ifelse(aic_weights >= 0.001, 
                     sprintf("%.3f", aic_weights),
                     sprintf("%.0e", aic_weights)),
     las = 1,
     cex.axis = 0.65,  # Reduced from 0.85
     col.axis = "navy",
     col.ticks = "navy")
```

**Result:** All 8 tick marks now display their labels without overlap (1.000, 0.368, 0.135, 0.007, 5e-05, 3e-11, 2e-22, 2e-109).

---

### **3. Increased Top Margin** (Line 267)

**Problem:** Plot title was butting against the top edge of the figure, creating visual crowding.

**Solution:** Increased top margin from 5 to 7 lines:

```r
# par(mar = c(bottom, left, top, right))
par(mar = c(5, 10, 7, 2))  # Increased from c(5, 10, 5, 2)
```

**Result:** 
- Title now has appropriate breathing room
- Top axis label fits comfortably between axis and title
- Overall visual hierarchy is cleaner

**Layout (bottom to top):**
- Line 3.5: Bottom axis label ("Œî AIC + 1")
- Line 2.5: Top axis label ("Relative AIC Weight")
- Line 3.8: Title ("Distribution of Œî AIC by Copula Family")
- Margin extends to line 7

---

### **4. Corrected Reference Line Colors** (Lines 342-352, 379-392)

**Problem:** Reference line colors didn't match statistical significance convention:
- Best fit (Œî = 0) was RED (typically reserved for strong effects)
- Moderate threshold (Œî = 10) was ORANGE (correct)
- Strong threshold (Œî = 100) was PURPLE (unconventional)

**Solution:** Updated colors to follow convention:

```r
# Reference lines
abline(v = 1, col = "black", lwd = 2, lty = 2)      # Œî = 0 (best fit)
abline(v = 11, col = "orange", lwd = 2, lty = 2)    # Œî = 10 (threshold)
abline(v = 101, col = "red", lwd = 1.5, lty = 3)    # Œî = 100 (strong threshold)

# Text annotations (updated to match)
text(x = 11, y = ..., labels = expression(Delta ~ "= 10"), col = "orange", ...)
text(x = 101, y = ..., labels = expression(Delta ~ "= 100"), col = "red", ...)
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Black (Œî = 0):** Reference line, best fit model
- **Orange (Œî = 10):** "Essentially no support" threshold (Burnham & Anderson)
- **Red (Œî = 100):** "Overwhelming evidence against" threshold (large samples)

**Verification of Placement:**
- All lines are placed at `delta + 1` to match the plot's offset
- v = 1 ‚Üí Œî = 0 ‚úì
- v = 11 ‚Üí Œî = 10 ‚úì
- v = 101 ‚Üí Œî = 100 ‚úì

## Additional Enhancements

### **Extended Grid Lines** (Lines 342-346)

Added grid line at x = 10,000,000 to support the extended axis:

```r
abline(v = c(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 10000000), 
       col = "gray80", 
       lty = 2, 
       lwd = 0.5)
```

## Visual Impact

### **Before:**
- Comonotonic results extended beyond plot area
- Top axis labels were crowded/missing
- Title crowded against top edge
- Reference line colors didn't follow convention

### **After:**
- All data contained within plot bounds
- All axis labels visible and readable
- Title has appropriate spacing
- Reference lines follow statistical color convention

‚úì Color-coded thresholds match statistical conventions  
‚úì Reference lines clearly marked and labeled  
‚úì Log scale effectively shows extreme range (0 to 10 million)  

### **Aesthetic Quality:**
‚úì Balanced composition  
‚úì Consistent color scheme (Wes Anderson Zissou1)

## Statistical Interpretation Guide

With these refinements, the plot clearly shows:

### **Best Fitting Models:**
- **t-copula**: Centered at Œî = 0 (black line), Weight = 1.000
- **t variants (df=15,10,5)**: Slightly higher Œî, progressively worse fit
- **Frank**: Œî ‚âà 10-100 range, Weight ‚âà 0.001-0.000

### **Poor Fitting Models:**
- **Gaussian**: Œî ‚âà 100-200, Weight ‚âà 10‚Åª¬≥‚Å∞
- **Clayton/Gumbel**: Œî ‚âà 1,000+, Weight ‚âà 0

### **Impossible Models:**
- **Comonotonic**: Œî ‚âà 2-4 million, Weight ‚âà 0 (infinitesimal)

The extended axis ensures even the extreme outlier (comonotonic) is properly visualized, demonstrating just how poorly it fits compared to realistic models.
