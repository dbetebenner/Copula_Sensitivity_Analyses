# GoF Testing Fix - Quick Summary

**Status**: ✅ FIXED  
**Date**: October 27, 2025

## What Was Wrong

GoF testing wasn't running because `N_BOOTSTRAP_GOF` wasn't being passed to parallel workers.

## What Was Fixed

Three changes to `STEP_1_Family_Selection/phase1_family_selection_parallel.R`:

1. **Lines 39-48**: Capture `N_BOOTSTRAP_GOF` before parallel processing
2. **Line 274**: Use captured value instead of checking `.GlobalEnv`
3. **Line 410**: Export captured value to workers

## How to Verify It's Working

When you run the analysis, you should see:

```
Goodness-of-Fit Testing: ENABLED (N = 100 bootstrap samples)
```

**Timing:**
- **Fast (~15 min)** = NOT working ❌
- **Slow (~1.5-2 hours)** = Working correctly ✅

## Ready to Run

Execute:
```r
source("run_test_multiple_datasets.R")
```

The analysis will now correctly perform 100 bootstrap samples for each copula × condition combination.
