## Status
Directory restructured and ready for GitHub. All 4 steps validated locally.

## Next Priority
Run full analysis on EC2 to generate complete results for paper integration.

## Key Decisions Made
1. t-copula selected in STEP_1 (95% selection rate)
2. Kernel Gaussian transformation validated in STEP_2 (K-S p=0.23)
3. Framework validated end-to-end

## Pending
- [ ] Push to GitHub as Copula_Sensitivity_Analyses
- [ ] Test EC2 workflow
- [ ] Generate final results for Paper_1

## Files Changed Recently
- Restructured into STEP_1 through STEP_4 directories
- Added comprehensive README files for each step
- Created master_analysis.R with configurable STEPS_TO_RUN

## For Next AI Session
Continue with EC2 setup testing or refine any step based on paper needs.
